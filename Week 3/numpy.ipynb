    "# Exercise Sheet 2: Timing, Numpy, Plotting\n",
    "\n",
    "The previous exercise sheet introduced several methods for classification: decision trees, nearest neighbors, and nearest means. Of those, the one that could learn from the data, and that also offered enough complexity to produce an accurate decision function was k-nearest neighbors. However, nearest neighbors can be slow when implemented in pure Python (i.e. with loops). This is especially the case when the number of data points or input dimensions is large.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise sheet, we will speed up nearest neighbors by utilizing `numpy`, `scipy` and `scikit-learn` (sklearn) packages. Your task will be to **replace list-based operations by vector-based operations** using numpy arrays. The speed and correctness of the implementations will then be tested. In particular, performance graphs will be drawn using the library `matplotlib`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure to have installed all the required packages (numpy, scipy, sklearn, matplotlib). For this you can use `conda install <package>` or `pip install <package>`.\n",
    "\n",
    "e.g. (-U will upgrade the package version if already installed)\n",

However, we can also specify a more optimized nearest neighbor function, for example, based on `numpy`.

    "As a starting point, the code below tests the output of the nearest neighbor algorithm for some toy dataset with fixed parameters. In particular, the function `data.toy(M,N,d)` generates a problem with `M` unlabeled test points stored in a matrix `U` of size `(M x d)`, then `N` labeled training points stored in a matrix `X` of size `(N x d)` and the output label is stored in a vector `Y` of size `N` composed of zeros and ones encoding the two possible classes. The variable `d` denotes the number of dimensions of each point. The toy dataset is pseudo-random, that is, for fixed parameters, it produces a random-looking dataset, but every time the method is called with the same parameters, the dataset is the same. The pseudo-randomness property will be useful to verify that each nearest neighbor implementation performs the same overall computation. Please check the `data.py` file within the exercise folder for the implementation details. "

    "The time on the vertical axis is in seconds. Note that the exact computation time depends on the speed of your computer. As expected, the computation time increases with the number of input dimensions. Unfortunately, for the small dataset considered here (`100` training and test points of `100` dimensions each), the algorithm already takes more than one second to execute. Thus, it is necessary for practical applications (e.g. the digit recognition task that we will consider at the end of this exercise sheet) to accelerate this nearest neighbor algorithm."

    "Our goal with this exercise is to speed up our code. In practice this means that we want to remove for loops from our code. Therefore your implementation should not contain a `for loop`. Similarly, Python functions that hide for loops such as `map` are also considered invalid for this exercise. Similarly, functions provided by numpy that \"hide\" for loops like [`vectorize`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.vectorize.html) and [`apply_along_axis`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.apply_along_axis.html) are also **not** to be used. Further the built-in function `sum` is not allowed to be used, however `np.sum` can be used.\n",

    "Create a plot similar to the one above, but that shows the computation time required by both methods shown in the same plot. There should be two lines, one for for `pydistance` and another for `npdistance`, displayed in the same plane. Here, we fix `M=100`, `N=100`, and we let `d` vary from `1` to `500`, taking the list of values `[1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500]`. Your plot should show a quasi-constant runtime for the `pybatch` call using the `npdistance` function, compared to `pydistance`."

    "Implement the function `npbatch(U,X,Y)` as a replacement of the implementation `pybatch(U,X,Y,nearest=npnearest)` that we have built in the previous exercise. Inside this function, use [`scipy.spatial.distance.cdist`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.spatial.distance.cdist.html) for the actual distance computation. When using `scipy.spatial.distance.cdist`, recall that our previous distance functions compute the squared euclidean distance, and to select the appropriate parameters to match this."

We consider a small handwritten digits recognition dataset, that can be directly obtained from the library `scikit-learn`. This dataset consists of handwritten digits of size `8 x 8` flattened into arrays of size `64`, with class between `0` and `9`. We use the function `data.digits()` to load the data and arrange data points in some predefined order."
